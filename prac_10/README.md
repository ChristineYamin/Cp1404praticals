# Reflection
## 1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
My accuracy in providing estimates for practical tasks generally improved over time as I learned the lectures weeks by weeks. Through this process, I gained insights into task complexity and slove the difficult tasks.

## 2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Actually , that code reviews are really helpful for my learning. I imporoved my coding skill because of that code reviews. My classmates gives reviews to my codes whether it is good or bad,  then, I know how to fix the codes. That is really helpful.When I reviewed their codes, I knew  other different  ways to write a code.By giving reviews to their codes, they can improve their coding skill too.

## 3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were incharge of this subjects,I will make the group presentation in order to get the experiences for the students. Additionally, I'd introduce more real-world projects that reflect the diverse applications of Python across different domains, from data analysis to automation.
